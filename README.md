# robust normalization

In [Miller et al. (2022)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aOX3a9q3RVV), we observe that divisive normalization improves robustness against adversarial attacks. This repo contains code for reproducing this phenomenon and tools for understanding it from a geometric perspective, using the [manifold analysis toolkit](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031003) by SueYeon Chung.
